# Language Reference

The Structurizr DSL provides a way to define a software architecture model
(based upon the [C4 model](https://c4model.com)) as text, using a domain
specific language (DSL). The [Structurizr
CLI](https://github.com/structurizr/cli) (command line interface) provides
tooling to parse DSL workspace definitions, upload them to the Structurizr cloud
service/on-premises installation, and export diagrams to other formats (e.g.
PlantUML and WebSequenceDiagrams). See
[https://structurizr.com/dsl](https://structurizr.com/dsl) for a demo of the
DSL.

__Please note that what you see here may not be available in the Structurizr CLI
yet, but it will likely be available on the [Structurizr DSL demo
page](https://structurizr.com/dsl).__
